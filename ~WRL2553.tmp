LFN PROJECT: Evaluation of Node Embedding Algorithms
Authors: Filippo D'Emilio, Pietro Volpato

Repository Structure
/data
This folder contains the datasets used in the project. Each graph is stored in its own subfolder, with the following files available:

.edges file: Defines the graph structure.
Node labels and/or node attributes (if available).
Additionally, the graph_references.txt file provides links to detailed information about each graph, including their source and how to download them.

/result
This folder contains the computed embedding vectors for the nodes in each graph. The naming convention of the files specifies the graph, algorithm, and dimension of the embeddings (e.g., facebook_LINE_128.npy).

The embeddings are stored as a 2D numpy array, where:
Each row corresponds to the embedding vector of a node.
Rows are ordered based on the integer renaming of nodes (from 0 to |V|-1).
For example, row index 5 corresponds to the embedding vector of the node labeled 5.
Note: If embeddings for the same graph, algorithm, and dimension already exist, they will be overwritten upon recomputation.

/src
This folder contains repositories and scripts for various node embedding algorithms.

Core Notebooks
1) LFN_project_embeddings.ipynb
This notebook is responsible for computing node embeddings.

Features:
Select the embedding algorithm and graph.
Tune algorithm-specific parameters to experiment with different configurations.
Save computed embeddings to the /result folder.
Important: If an embeddings file already exists for the chosen graph, algorithm, and dimension, it will be overwritten.

2) LFN_project_metrics.ipynb
This notebook implements metrics to evaluate the quality of the embeddings.

Features:
Evaluate reconstruction error and neighborhood preservation for all available embeddings.
Perform tasks on a specific graph-algorithm pair:
Node classification: Train an SVC classifier using node labels (if available; see graph_references.txt).
Link prediction: Train a logistic regression classifier to predict the existence of edges.
Clustering: Use k-means to cluster the embedding space and visualize the clustering on the original graph.
How to Use
Compute Embeddings:

Open LFN_project_embeddings.ipynb.
Select the graph and embedding algorithm.
(Optional) Tune parameters for the selected algorithm.
Run the notebook to compute and save embeddings.
Evaluate Embeddings:

Open LFN_project_metrics.ipynb.
Load embeddings from the /result folder.
Choose a metric or task (e.g., node classification, link prediction).
Visualize or analyze the results.
